Financial Data Chat Bot Documentation

Overview
This project implements a Flask-based chat bot that analyzes financial data from a CSV file (10-K Filings.csv). It preprocesses the data to compute key financial metrics and allows users to query specific information about companies listed in the dataset.

Functionality

Data Preprocessing: Loads and cleans financial data from the CSV file.
Converts relevant columns to numeric types and calculates year-over-year changes for financial metrics.

Query Handling: Provides predefined queries for specific financial metrics and companies.
Responds to user queries through a web interface.

Web Interface: Users can input queries via a web form (/query route).
Queries are processed to retrieve and display relevant financial information.

Predefined Queries

Microsoft Queries: "What was Microsoft's Net Income in Fiscal Year 2022?"
"What were Microsoft's Total Liabilities in Fiscal Year 2021?"

Tesla Queries: "What were Tesla's Total Assets in Fiscal Year 2021?"
"What was Tesla's Cash Flow from Operations (CFFO) in Fiscal Year 2022?"

Apple Queries: "What was Apple's Total Revenue in Fiscal Year 2023?"
"What is Apple's Return on Assets (ROA) for the latest fiscal year?"


Limitations

Data Scope: Limited to the dataset (10-K Filings.csv), does not support queries outside predefined metrics.
Real-Time Data: Operates on static data, not real-time financial updates.
Query Flexibility: Requires predefined query format, does not support natural language processing.
Data Accuracy: Depends on accuracy of data in the CSV file.
